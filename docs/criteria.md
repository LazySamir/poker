# Criteria
- It should meet all the functional requirements outlined in the test description, which you
will receive separately.
- There should be a README.
- The README should be written in Markdown.
- The README should include instructions for running the code locally.
- There should be >85% test coverage.
- Tests should include feature tests. Feature tests are high-level tests meant to exercise
slices of functionality through an application. They should drive the application only via
its external interface, e.g. its web pages.
- Code coverage should be measured programatically (e.g. with simplecov or similar).
- Code should be on GitHub.
- There should be some commit history showing your progress.
- There should be no secrets (e.g. API keys) committed.
- Classes and methods should have comment blocks explaining what they do. Any lines
of code that aren’t easily readable should also be commented.
- Variables, methods and classes should have readable & understandable names.
- There should be no leftover dependencies.
- Code should be deployed somewhere, publicly available, e.g. Heroku or Now.
- It should work across the latest versions of IE, Edge, Firefox, Safari and Chrome.
- It should work on your phone (let us know which platform you tested on).
- Pixie Labs use up-to-date MacBooks with Homebrew installed. Your code should run
on our machines. If you haven’t used a Mac to write your code, we will take that into
account if we have any issues.
